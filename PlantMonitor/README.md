Monitor the water content of the plant and temperature

Light up the front with bar of neopixels for hydrometer and colour for temperature (Done the neopixels, hydrometer needs voltage divider, temperature needs another sensor)

Web interface to update the allowed values for both temp and humidity
* Set Max / Min based on current value
* Manually update the max /min


Interface into something like grafana

Create network and allow webpage to setup wifi setting (Done but wifi not working well)
